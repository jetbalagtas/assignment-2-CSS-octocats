# Intro to HTML/CSS Layout

## Quick note from Jet

This repo was originally inside another "TIYLessons" repo. It's still there. I just moved a copy of it to its own repo for easier discovery. Based on the [old location](https://github.com/jetbalagtas/TIYLessons), work was done Oct. 7, 2015. This was our second assignment for our 12-week bootcamp. No other edits have been made except for this new README file. Thanks for checking it out!
